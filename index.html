        The Indigenous Voices Archive is a comprehensive digital repository dedicated to preserving, promoting, and revitalizing Indigenous languages across North America. Our mission is to provide accessible, organized, and up-to-date resources for language learners, educators, researchers, and community members.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        We recognize that Indigenous languages are not merely communication tools but living embodiments of unique worldviews, cultural knowledge, and ancestral wisdom. Each language represents thousands of years of human experience and connection to the land.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        This archive serves as a bridge between traditional knowledge keepers and new generations of learners, supporting the vital work of language revitalization happening in communities across the continent.
