                    <p>Indigenous languages carry the **wisdom, stories and cultural heritage** of communities that have stewarded this land for thousands of years. Yet many of these irreplaceable linguistic treasures face the threat of disappearing forever. Our platform serves as a digital sanctuary where **indigenous communities, linguists and language enthusiasts** can come together to preserve oral traditions and support vital revitalization work.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">**Regarding organization:** We recognize that language is tied to Nation, Tribe, and Land. While the main tabs provide quick access by resource *type* (App, Book), **every resource is prominently tagged with its Coverage Area and Language**. This allows you to prioritize a geographical search and locate culturally relevant materials first. We are committed to ethical archiving practices and community control.</p>
