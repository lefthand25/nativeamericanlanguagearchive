      <h2>About Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Indigenous languages carry wisdom, stories, and cultural heritage of communities that have stewarded this land for thousands of years. Yet many of these irreplaceable linguistic treasures face the threat of disappearing forever. Our platform serves as a digital sanctuary where indigenous communities, linguists, and language enthusiasts can come together to preserve oral traditions and support vital revitalization work.</p>
